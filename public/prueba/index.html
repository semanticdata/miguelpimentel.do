          You’ve come across <strong>Forgotten Notes</strong>—a
          <a href="/notes/Digital%20Garden/">digital garden</a> of knowledge.
          Come in and make yourself comfortable.
        </p>
        <p>
          This website serves as a platform for my learning and creative
          endeavours. A space for thinking through, building upon, and coming
          back to. It is part of my effort to organize my own theories,
          concepts, and ideas in a more public setting.
        </p>
        <p>
          You will find within a wide range of topics, expanding and exploring
          ideas across multiple disciplines. In a way, you could say the
          <a href="/notes/Scope%20of%20Work/">scope of work</a> for the website
          is not only allowed to, but expected to grow. Forgotten Notes embraces
          the inherent
          <a href="/notes/Rhizomatic%20Learning/">rhizomatic learning</a> and
          web-like nature of our thinking. It is a living document designed for
          an audience of one, myself.
        </p>
        <p>
          Like me, all notes contained within should be considered
          work-in-progress. Expect changes at all content levels. That said, I
          try not to let perfectionism get in the way. That means what you read
          here is not authoritative or complete, and is not representative of my
          best work. Please keep that in mind as you navigate around the garden.
          I’m glad you are here. Enjoy your visit!
        </p>
        <p>Thanks for visiting. Please tell your dog (or cat) I said “Hi”!</p>
