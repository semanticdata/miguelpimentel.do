> **MiguelPimentel.do** is created using [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/).

## Background

My website has gone through many changes. I have not been shy about moving from technology to technology as I learn new things. Coming across the world of [[./Static Site Generators|Static Site Generators]] was a game changer. I have ran my notes through [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), [MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/), [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/), and most recently [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/).

## Technology

All content for the site is written in Markdown within [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)â€”an extensible, flexible note-taking app. To export the notes from Obsidian, I rely on the [GitHub Publisher](https://github.com/ObsidianPublisher) plugin.

The [source code](https://github.com/semanticdata/miguelpimentel.do) is hosted in [GitHub](https://github.com/). From here we use [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) to build and deploy the site.
