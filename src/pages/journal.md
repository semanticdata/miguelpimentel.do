<!-- # Journal -->

This page takes inspiration from the [Journal of an Enigmatic Mind](https://speyllsite.pages.dev/journal/). It explores the concept of keeping a public journal, something I haven't done before.

## 2024

### March

- Backed up my past personal websites inside [semanticdata.github.io](https://github.com/semanticdata/semanticdata.github.io) using different branches.
- Currently using [Eleventy Vite](https://github.com/matthiasott/eleventy-plus-vite) to publish [MiguelPimente.do](https://miguelpimentel.do). The plan is to transition to a new starter I'm working on.
- Refreshed all my notes within [Forgetful Notes](https://forgetfulnotes.com/). Revised the desktop layouts.
- Learning [Nunjucks](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/) to use it as templating engine within [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/).
- Revisited my [GitHub Stars](https://github.com/semanticdata/github-stars). Removed a lot of unused ones and added the interesting ones to my [Raindrop.io](https://rindrop.io) [public page](https://raindrop.io/SemanticData). The rest can be found in [this repository](https://github.com/semanticdata/github-stars).
- Learning about [HTTP Headers](https://vercel.com/docs/edge-network/headers) and how to apply them via `vercel.json` in the repository root.
  - [Mozilla Observatory](https://observatory.mozilla.org/) is my choice to check headers and other security evaluations.
- Took up the [One HTML Page Challenge](onehtmlpagechallenge.com). Find my source code [here](https://github.com/semanticdata/one-html-page-challenge).
  - This is not a short term project. Planning to add things as I learn, etc.
- I dropped [Bulma](https://bulma.io/) in favor of [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) to use in my current project.
  - I'm also using [DaisyUI](daisyui.com/) that plays well with TailwindCSS.

### February

- Discovered NASA's [Astronomy Picture of the Day](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/).
- After checking out [Astro](https://astro.build/), I decided it wasn't time to jump into it. For now, using [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/) feels adequate given my knowledge level. I will definitely give Astro another go, once I am more comfortable with [[Svelte]].
- Updated my [Obsidian Starter Vault](https://github.com/semanticdata/obsidian-starter-vault) project. Now includes more information about the CSS snippets, community plugins, and general workflows included in it.
- Forked these [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) [Minimal theme](https://github.com/kepano/obsidian-minimal) [CSS Snippets](https://github.com/replete/obsidian-minimal-theme-css-snippets).
- Added new CSS Snippets to my vault. I'll probably end up posting them later.
- Republished my personal website using [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/) and [elva](https://github.com/scottsweb/elva). Moved the site to `semanticdata.github.io`. It is currently deployed with Vercel. Will use a different starter and drop `elva` soon.
- Contributions:
  - Added Spanish translations for [Quartz](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz) in [PR #822](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz/pull/822).

### January

- Archived many of my inactive GitHub repositories.
- Compiled my GitHub stars in [this repo](https://github.com/semanticdata/github-stars) with the help of [maguowei/starred](https://github.com/maguowei/starred).
- Submitted Spanish translations for [gethyas/doks-core](https://github.com/gethyas/doks-core).
- Started playing around with [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/). Taking a look at [Eleventy Excellent](https://github.com/madrilene/eleventy-excellent), and [Eleventy Garden](https://github.com/binyamin/eleventy-garden).
- Learned about [Astro](https://astro.build/). I'm playing around with it and some website starters.
- Discovered [CUBE CSS](https://cube.fyi/), [Utopia](https://utopia.fyi/), and [buildexcellentwebsit.es](https://buildexcellentwebsit.es/).
- Fixed the search module not working in [Forgetful Notes](https://github.com/semanticdata/forgetful-notes).
- Revived [Firefox TabSpace](https://github.com/semanticdata/firefox-tabspace). Cleaned the repo and published updated version.

## 2023

### December

- Finally visited the [Dominican Republic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominican_Republic) after more than 8 years without going.

### November

- Ported the Chrome extension [Text Revealer](https://github.com/jamigibbs/text-revealer-chrome-extension) to Firefox.
- Updated my [Obsidian Starter](https://github.com/semanticdata/obsidian-starter-vault) vault.
- Playing around with [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/), and [Milkdown](https://milkdown.dev/).

> I'm still defining what exactly I should include in this journal. I'm currently making sure it's not _too_ technical, or difficult to read.
