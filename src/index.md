Hi, I'm Miguel—problem solver, hobby developer, music enjoyer, and public infrastructure enthusiast based in Minnesota, US.

I think a lot, work a lot, have existential crises, and know just enough about making websites to make me dangerous. While I like writing, reading, coding, and listening to music, I _**love**_ having a problem to solve.

Thanks for visiting. Tell your 🐶 said "Hi!".
