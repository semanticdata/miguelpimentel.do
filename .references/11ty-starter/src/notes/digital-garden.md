# Digital Garden

## What is a Digital Garden

A digital garden is a combination of an **online notebook** and a **personal wiki**, where digital gardeners write in small, unfinished pieces, also known as [[Atomic Notes|atomic notes]], and share these seeds of thought to be cultivated in public. Digital gardens are curated and evolve over time, sometimes growing wildly and sometimes getting pruned.

The phrase _"digital garden"_ comes up often while browsing these notes. Surely I overuse it. That said, I still like it. It more closely describes what I envision this website to be: a carefully curated garden of digital notes. Having a reliable system on which to dump raw information is extremely useful. The idea of [[Sweep Your Mind|sweeping]] one's mind is helpful to rid yourself of distractions from incorrectly prioritized tasks.

## How is Content Curated

Digital Gardens are explorable rather than structured as a strictly linear stream of posts. They grow slowly over time, rather than created as _"finished"_ work that is to never be touched again. A place where little changes accumulate and transform thoughts and ideas. As you [[Continuous Care|continuously care]] for your garden, you **revise**, **update**, and **change** your ideas as they develop.

## Kinds of Notes

- ðŸŒ±Â _Seedlings_Â for very rough and early ideas.
- ðŸŒ¿Â _Budding_Â for work I've cleaned up and clarified.
- ðŸŒ³Â _Evergreen_Â for work that is reasonably complete (though I still tend these over time).
