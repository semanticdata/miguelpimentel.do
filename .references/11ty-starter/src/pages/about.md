### Hi! I'm Miguel

I am a problem solver, hobby developer, music enjoyer, and public infrastructure enthusiast based in Minnesota, US.

You can find me under different nicknames around (e.g. [Data](https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/character/20296985/), [Ezra](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/User:Ezra_Salaz)). I think a lot, work a lot, have existential crises, and know just enough about making websites to make me dangerous. I enjoy writing, reading, coding, listening to music, and love having a problem to solve.

If you are aching for more, check out what [[Tools|tools]] I use daily, or read my [Journal](/journal).

### As of January 2024, I am…

… learning about web dev with [[Zola|Zola]].  
… making simple browser [extensions](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/17772574/).  
… collecting bookmarks with [Raindrop](https://raindrop.io/SemanticData).  
… compiling [configuration files](https://github.com/semanticdata/dotfiles) in [GitHub](https://github.com/).  
… developing a [theme](https://github.com/semanticdata/obsidian-sample-theme) for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/).
