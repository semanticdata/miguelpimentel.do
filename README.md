## 📄 Description

This repository holds the source code for my personal website—currently built with [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/).

I'm trying to learn some [CI/CD](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/devops/what-is-ci-cd) by deploying this project to all these places:

[![Vercel](https://img.shields.io/badge/vercel-%23000000.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=vercel&logoColor=white)](https://miguelpimentel.do/) [![Github Pages](https://img.shields.io/badge/github%20pages-121013?style=for-the-badge&logo=github&logoColor=white)](https://semanticdata.github.io/miguelpimentel.do/) [![Netlify](https://img.shields.io/badge/netlify-%23000000.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=netlify&logoColor=#00C7B7)](https://miguelpimentel.netlify.app)

## 🚀 Getting Started

**1. Clone repo**

```sh
git clone https://github.com/semanticdata/miguelpimentel.do.git
```

**2. Install dependencies**

```sh
pnpm install
```

**3. Run the project locally**

```sh
pnpm start
```

## ✨ Features

- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev) as Middleware in Eleventy Dev Server (uses [eleventy-plugin-vite](https://github.com/11ty/eleventy-plugin-vite/))
- Eleventy build output is post-processed by [Vite](https://vitejs.dev) (with Rollup)
- CSS/[Sass](https://github.com/sass/sass) post-processing with [PostCSS](https://github.com/postcss/postcss) including [Autoprefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer) and [cssnano](https://github.com/cssnano/cssnano).
- Uses [my own opinionated CSS/Sass structure](https://matthiasott.com/notes/how-i-structure-my-css)
- Critical CSS, generated and inlined via [rollup-plugin-critical](https://github.com/nystudio107/rollup-plugin-critical). The main CSS file is then loaded asynchronously with [Scott Jehl’s `media` loading strategy](https://www.filamentgroup.com/lab/load-css-simpler/) (adds `media="print"` and swaps to `media="all"` once loaded)
- Example implementation of a web font loading strategy ([critical FOFT with preload](https://www.zachleat.com/web/comprehensive-webfonts/#critical-foft-preload))
- Basic fluid typography based on [Utopia](https://utopia.fyi)
- Basic dark mode support (using `prefers-color-scheme` and CSS Custom Properties)
- Polyfill for [focus-visible](https://matthiasott.com/notes/focus-visible-is-here)

## 🎨 Customization

Add your custom CSS code within `/src/assets/css/_custom.scss`.

## 🧬 Quirks

Only compatible with `"title-case": "^3.0.3",` as `^4.0.0` breaks the site. Will look into it at some point.

## ⛑ Useful Commands

**Install dependencies**

```sh
pnpm install
```

**Update dependencies**

```sh
pnpm update
```

**Start local dev server**

```sh
pnpm start
```

**Check formatting w/ Prettier**

```sh
pnpm run check
```

**Fix formatting w/ Prettier**

```sh
pnpm run format
```

## 🛠️ Technology

The site uses various technologies cobbled together. Some of those are:

- [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/): a static site generator with a rich feature set for fetching data, composing layouts, and inserting content with "shortcodes."

- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/): a bundler that takes the boilerplate out of your set up. It'll compile JS component frameworks, handle CSS preprocessors with little-to-no config (say, SCSS and PostCSS), and show dev changes on-the-fly using hot module replacement (HMR).
